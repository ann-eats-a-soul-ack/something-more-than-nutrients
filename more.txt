something more than nutrients




there is probably a study 
about how many ppl around the world
eat eggs for breakfast 
but I can’t find it 
so just know the percentage is high 

eggs have never tasted the same 
after I ate them in Bosnia 
the yolks were vivid orange, the whites were crisp
there was never jelly on a sunnyside up
we ate paradajz, eggs, bread & kajmak 
almost every morning 
the simplicity never got sickening 

in Zenica, Bosnia there is a scrambled eggs festival 
on the first day of spring 
no one knows how the tradition started 
but ppl still gather at dawn 
to scramble hundreds of eggs in fuck-off huge pans
they’re celebrating the promise of life 
returning with the warmth of the season
& the idea of a new beginning 
knowing ppl everywhere are gathering over eggs 
despite the proof of their pasts 
is a comforting image bringing me to the table

I once made enough cauliflower egg soup 
for a whole month
it took me five hours 
I ate it three nights in a row then left it to rot for a week
I froze it out of shame 
when my housemate said it would be a waste 
it took up three containers in the freezer 
until the end of our lease
when I crushed it with a spoon & boiled water

this soup used to mean family to me
but the visible decay
& the act of shattering a frozen memory 
was the exact measurement of pain
I couldn’t deal with
I didn’t want anyone to witness the moment 
because I didn’t want it to be real
having no choice but to dispose of 
something I’d neglected 
the chunks of cauliflower, the whisps of egg 
like a shopping list full of my faults 
& this time I remembered to carry it with me 
this time I’d know the ingredients 
for the rot I’d caused

today, I’m sundering kupus so I can show u my heart 
I’m all sour inside but it’s the kind of sour that 
ppl work on for months to ferment 
it’s escaping the constant needs of life 
as if it were gourmet

I remember shucking hazelnuts 
while Tetke shared gossip & wisdom 
younger rodice refusing to leave the cool 
of a curtained bedroom 
ruževina & paradajz from Baba’s bašta 

I miss the kind of food preparation 
that felt like seasoning myself
with the rituals of my family & friends 
like each bowl of ingredients was a new lesson 
on who they had been & I could be 

in Taemin’s vlog, he eats pork belly, kimchi
& chocolate chex for breakfast 
& butterflies are thirsty for animal’s tears 
so my thirst for kajmak mushrooms & matcha ice cream
doesn’t seem as strange 
craving is a fog u walk through 
until it’s clear again

Panda tells me an overload of pine nuts 
makes everything u eat taste like iron 
for the next 24 hours 
research shows it can last up to two weeks 
& is referred to as pine mouth 
I already knew the price of pinenuts was high 
but I didn’t realise it would disturb my taste 
as well as my bank account

all the best meals I’ve had in life 
have nothing to do with money 
it’s the pork & scalloped potatoes on my birthday 
when we couldn’t afford meat 
for a whole month 
it’s Panda bringing bubble tea, hotpot, sichuan peppers 
& condensed milk into my life
& delivering congee after Baba’s passing
it’s flatmates cooking a Christmas feast 
for an unspecified amount of guests
it’s Minji gifting me gochugaru 
& Anne offering crates of wine
& Baba’s sutlijaš

I remember making chicken schnitzels in the dark 
while my whole flat watched the second season of planet earth 
they lined up the chairs & couches like a theatre 
& projected it onto the wall of the dining room
I remember cooking on low heat 
because I was worried the sizzling 
would disturb the ritualistic viewing 

I miss my friend bursting into our flat 
while stirring his dinner in a pot 
then leaving the pot on our stove to cook 
or when he arrived with pakoras 
for us from his family 
because they were cooking for themselves 
& had extra to share

the only food beliefs I’ve held onto 
are these three that Anne & I agreed upon:
garlic is a plant so it counts as one of ur five a day 
ovens are actually just garlic bread temples 
ppl who bring beer on stage to perform poems 
& then sip on it mid poem think they’re so cool 
but they’re not

so I should perform a poem at an event with a loaf of garlic bread 
& take a huge bite of it, chewing slowly
& the audience will just have to wait until it’s gone 
unsure if the poem is over or not 

a friend says I always take her warm places 
I’d like to think the happiness it gives her is enough 
u just have to want food to save u
I tell her if I didn’t know which warm places to cling to
I wouldn’t be meeting her IRL 

I can take ppl to warm places 
because other ppl took me 
& other ppl took them too
because Panda always has at least three suggestions 
for where to eat 
& orders exactly the right combination of dishes 
that makes life feel possible again
because Mama has a recipe book 
full of ideas from her three sisters, her friends,
& her own Mama
all I know about food I’ve been taught
or have learnt by mistake 

there is a guy in Philly 
that invited ppl to an abandoned pier 
to watch him consume one whole rotisserie chicken
on his fortieth consecutive day of eating whole rotisserie chickens
this kind of performative eating 
reminds me that every meal in public is a performance 
of taking care of urself

Mama & our komšija talk about kafa in winter 
rotating the green beans u kiln, na žaru 
shaking & spinning the stick so the beans roast evenly 
the aroma spreading from the movement 
& everyone in the komšiluk knowing 
u were making fresh kafa 
how they’d all arrive to gossip 
how when they were younger 
they hated the noise & crowding in a small room 
but now they know 
this was the only kind of therapy they had before 

I miss my rodjak cooking slaninu from the sušara, 
saying it's their speciality, a delicacy 
the way I’d never liked cured meat
the way family teased me 
for not knowing sausages & salami 
are the good stuff 
but the slanina he prepared on that day 
was exactly the right amount of salt I’d needed 
to satiate my stress about the new year of study 
I was about to begin

never feeling sustained 
means pursuing my past through food
I’m indulging in baby biscuits 
because it reminds me of my extended family 
I’m eating them crushed & sprinkled like a topping 
I’m a regular at restaurants 
when the weather strains me
even if it means I’ll afford fewer groceries tomorrow

I don’t know if I have ever known how to cultivate a body 
I was never good at the sims
it’s pitched as lives u can curate
with guides on how to improve their journeys
but all of their decaying needs scared me 
how does a human know their needs so clearly & urgently?

I’ve learned that baby birds are fed by their parents 
& don’t have to worry about worms running away from them 
until their parents decide they’re grown enough 
to catch food themselves 
I wonder at what age birds understand 
that food doesn’t hop into ur mouth when it sees u 

when I was a baby teen 
food was not my responsibility 
I was a baby teen 
& I didn’t fear passing out in a Coles aisle 
next to the alternative milks
don’t know at what age u’re supposed to stop being baby 

for as long as I can remember, Tata has said 
nikad neznaš šta imaju tamo, možda te ostave gladno 
& he’s right, u can’t ever know 
if ppl will feed u the way u need to be fed

I miss what food meant to me 

I miss watching charcoal glow under the spit 
the juice of freshly charred kukuruz running down my chin 

I even miss Tečo calling me a pig 
for snatching pečenke from the side of the fire pit
instead of waiting for the lamb

kad Teco pravi rostilj the whole neighbourhood drops by 
they all have a recipe or experience to share 
kako se kuva, i kad se soli 
Teco pours rakija for each komšija 

I miss eating with ppl 
because my worst meals have always been alone

I remember the time I pounded the fridge 
like it would materialise a meal if I wanted it enough

I’m waiting for food to cast a spell on me
for a life-changing meal, the kind that says 

fuck ur past, u don’t need it 
fuck ur future, it’s not here yet 
u’re going to eat with ur hands 
& lick the plate clean 
suck ur fingers 
& use ur teeth 
to scrape what’s left under ur nails 
u know the savouring will 
mean something 
u’re just not 
sure what
