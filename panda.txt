I read an interview with Chelsea Hodson & she says
 
‘when I feel hopeless,
I turn things into other things’
 
a poem means literally
a made thing,
 
as in sometimes
love makes me feel hopeless
as in it’s as vast as the fatberg
they found choking up london’s sewers
love can feel inert, inefficient
as in it’s a lost monkey wrapped up in a shearling coat at ikea
peering out the sliding doors at the big bad world
 
a made thing
why is everything about process
or transformation, the only way
I know how to understand things is
by making them into something I can chew up &
spit out
dirty little spitwads of words
 
a made thing
as in my family will never read my poems
but I keep writing odes to them
as in every poem
it feels like a dog that’s been
lovingly knitted jumpers out of their own fur
& then posed for very-normal-not-at-all-weird
pet portraits
 
things knot
& felt & twist into each other
& still don’t make sense
but a poem is a made thing &
if that’s not love, then 
wtf
 
do you ever not
think of your mother?
 




















I want this for my mother
 
do you think home will be the same
when they die?



























 
I have a history of
going full sicko mode
to be selfish & free 
even though it’s impossible

I’m intertwined with my family
 
Were we two from the start
And was our time an entrance
or an ending
 
sometimes people (cc:parents) love u too much
& it’s like … don’t u know I’m a brat?
don’t you know that I fundamentally fail at growing up?
don’t you know I cry every birthday without fail?
don’t you know that I used to
shoplift zucchini flowers, to dust in flour &
stuff with similarly thieved ricotta,
to borrow a feeling of financial security?
don’t you know that I have accidentally started 3 fires in my lifetime?
don’t you know that I relate heavily to the mimosa pudica? 
as in shrinks away from touch
as in sensitive plant
as in I AM BABY HEAR ME ROAR
 
love of any sort just feels like snail-fucking
like being stabbed with tiny love darts
 
I have calculated
the carbon footprint
I will leave if I go home
it will cost me
47 dollars to offset
22.5 tonnes of
CO2
 
I come from a swamp,
which is another way to say I relate a lot to shrek
lots of impenetrable layers
lots of very penetrable layers!
like an onion
a big onion
a huuuuuuuuge onion

 
it’s a long way to travel to be the
family disappointment
 
so
 I don’t go

what
do you think they were like 
without us?
 

























 
under the false sky of
a workplace ceiling to the
soft chatter of my co-workers
talking about married at first sight
I watch bubbles collide
inside a water cooler & think about how

thinking about
my most distinct childhood memory/dream 
(someone told me
that children don’t have real memories
 just memories of being told about those memories)
my parents took me to a crocodile farm in Miri when i was 5 
(this is certified fact)
(& this part is unverified) but my foot fell through
a crack in the bridge, poised above snapping jaws,
raw chicken bodies floating to muddy surface,
then was pulled up by parents
dream or memory or not
I wasn’t scared.

sometimes I’m a stranger to my family
but not in my poems
just because you love someone
doesn’t mean you know them—
my poems present the option of
them seeing the crack in the bridge,
& pulling me up anyways

what silences have
you
said yes to?

















what do their names
mean to you?




























 
my dad’s name 
王是亨
 Means lucky one
but google translate thinks that it is
Henry
 
my mum’s name is so beautiful,
too beautiful for this world 
it means dream orchid forest

it’s a point of contention that I
haven’t & won’t use my birth name
but it shrivels in comparison
put it in the bin & set the bin on fire!!!
 
I think of our love as 
a flower pulsing between two chasms 
a monster cannibal galaxy 
gulping up planets with fine cutlery 
clattering/smashing/clacking
a knife-wielding crow that’s become a newfound father

softness finds its edges somehow
 
 why is it easier to write a poem
than it is to talk to your parents??
 
 lol
 




































/the ones you love?

maybe everything in the whole fkn world…
 
 I watched this film Yi Yi  
& I totally lost my shit as in 
sometimes I love movies because they turn off my tiny animal brain 
& sometimes I love movies when they gut me, think sabrage! knife splitting champagne bottle neck but performed on the 86 tram, spraying innocent commuters
 
there’s this meta scene 
where weirdo/lonely/young/sweet protagonist 
watches AV presentation about clouds 
gets me thinking about how clouds 
drift into each other’s personal space 
without invitation or permission
 









 
often, we overlook their beauty
 
sorry to anthropomorphise
 clouds can still exist as their own entities
even with my sick tendency to project on everything
 
they plunge back to earth
 
constantly overlapping scenes in this film
like this scene slowly receding to real rain like this scene
where laughter crossfades into crying
 it’s like everything is always 
trickling into & across each other
family is osmosis
boundaries are porous
 it’s like this scene where 
supporting character is 
pacing next to ocean at night-time
sorry I just like noticing these things
 




 
 
everything is just a type of arrangement
 
everything is a made thing



 
how clouds come apart
 

 
 
to come back together
